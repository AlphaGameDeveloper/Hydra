<h1>Hydra</h1>
Encryption, hashing, checksums, hash cracker, and more!
<h2>How do I use this?</h2>
There are multiple ways to use Hydra:
<ul>
  <li>A GUI, accessable by either running <code>hydra.exe gui</code>.</li>
  <li>NoGUI mode, accessable by running <code>hydra.exe nogui</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>I see a <code>config.json</code> file;  What is it?</h2>
<code>config.json</code> is a way to modify Hydra's settings that it reads on startup.  It is read on startup to get all of the settings.  You can use the configgen executable to more easily modify the basics;  You can also manually modify the file using your preferred text editor.
<h1>ConfigGen</h1>
ConfigGen, as stated above is a config generator for Hydra.  It is a seperate executable.  <b>IT IS NOT NEEDED TO RUN HYDRA.</b>
<h1>When will it be released?</h1>
Soon.  (In the next 2 weeks to 1 month.)<br>
<b>I do not want to release the first build with half working or unused stuff in it.</b>
